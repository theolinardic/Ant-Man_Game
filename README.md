# Ant-Man Inspired Game


My Ant-Man game is a small project, inspired by the Ant-Man films, I created in Unity using C#. In the game, two players can both shrink and grow and must use these abilities to solve puzzles. The players can also shoog discs that shrink or grow any object. 


The game features a fully dynamic split screen that changes size depending on which player has priority at the moment. For example, when Player 1 jumps onto the hand of the grown Player 2, the split screen changes so that Player 2 can see more.


To see examples of all of the mechanics, please see the gifs on my [*portfolio website*](https://www.theodorelinardic.com/co-op-shrinking-game).
